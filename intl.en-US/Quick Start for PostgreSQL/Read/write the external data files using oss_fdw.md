# Read/write the external data files using oss\_fdw {#concept_d23_m3g_wdb .concept}

In Alibaba Cloud, you can use the oss\_fdw plugin to load data on OSS to PostgreSQL and PPAS databases, and you can also write data in a database to OSS.

## oss\_fdw parameters {#section_cvf_43g_wdb .section}

Similar to other fdw interfaces, oss\_fdw can encapsulate data stored on OSS \(external data source\), allowing you to read files on OSS, like reading data from a table. oss\_fdw provides unique parameters used to connect to and parse file data on OSS.

**Note:** 

-   Currently, oss\_fdw can read and write the following file types in OSS: text/csv files and text/csv files in GZIP format.
-   The value of each parameter needs to be quoted and does not contain any useless spaces.

## CREATE SERVER parameters {#section_smy_p3g_wdb .section}

-   ossendpoint: Address \(host\) used to access OSS from the intranet.
-   id: OSS account ID.
-   key: OSS account key.
-   bucket: OSS bucket, assigned after an OSS account is created.

The following parameters are related to error tolerance in import and export modes. If network connectivity is bad, you can adjust these parameters to make the import and export successful.

-   oss\_connect\_timeout: Connection timeout time, measured in seconds. Default value: 10s.

-   oss\_dns\_cache\_timeout: DNS timeout time, measured in seconds. Default value: 60s.

-   oss\_speed\_limit: Minimum tolerable rate. Default value: 1,024 Bytes/s \(1 Kbps\).

-   oss\_speed\_time: Maximum tolerable time. Default value: 15s.


If the default parameter values are used, a timeout error occurs when the transmission rate is smaller than 1 Kbps for 15 consecutive seconds.

## CREATE FOREIGN TABLE parameters {#section_hhj_r3g_wdb .section}

-   filepath: File name indicating a path on OSS.

    -   A file name contains a path but not a bucket name.

    -   This parameter matches multiple files in the corresponding path on OSS, and supports file loading to a database.

    -   Files named in the format of filepath or filepath.x can be imported to a database. x in filepath.x must start from 1 and be consecutive.

        For instance, filepath, filepath.1, filepath.2, filepath.3, and filepath.5. The first four files are matched and imported, but the file named filepath.5 is not.

-   dir: Virtual directory on OSS.

    -   dir must end with a slash \(/\).

    -   All files \(excluding subfolders and files in subfolders\) in the virtual directory indicated by dir are matched and imported to a database.

-   prefix: Prefix of the path of the data file. Regular expressions are not supported. You can set only one of the these parameters: prefix, filepath, and dir.
-   format: File format, which can only be CSV currently.

-   encoding: File data encoding format. Support the common PostgreSQL encoding formats, such as UTF-8.

-   parse\_errors: Parsing in error tolerance mode. The errors that occur during the file parsing process are ignored by row.

-   delimiter: The delimiter specified for columns.

-   quote: The quote character for a specified file.

-   escape: Escape character for a specified file.

-   null: Used to nullify the column matching a specified string. For example, null 'test' is used to set the column whose value is 'test' to null.

-   force\_not\_null: Used to un-nullify the value of one or more columns. For example, force\_not\_null 'id' is used to set the values of the 'id' column to empty strings.

-   compressiontype: Used to set whether the file read or written on OSS is compressed and set the compression format. Value range:

    -   none: Uncompressed \(default value\)
    -   gzip: compressed gzip file
-   compressionlevel: Used to set the compression level of the compression format written to the OSS, ranging from 1 to 9. The default value is 6.


**Note:** 

-   filepath and dir need to be specified in the OPTIONS parameter.
-   Either filepath and dir must be specified, and they cannot be specified at the same time.
-   The export mode currently only supports virtual folders, that is, only dir is supported, not filepath.

## Export mode parameters for CREATE FOREIGN TABLE {#section_sxg_t3g_wdb .section}

oss\_flush\_block\_size and oss\_file\_max\_size are added to export mode.

-   oss\_flush\_block\_size: Buffer size for the data written to OSS at a time; default value: 32 MB; value range: 1 MB to 128 MB.

-   oss\_file\_max\_size: Maximum file size for the data written to OSS \(subsequent data is written in another file when the maximum file size is exceeded\); default value: 1,024 MB; value range: 8 MB to 4,000 MB.

-   num\_parallel\_worker: The number of parallel compression threads in the compression mode in which the OSS data is written, ranging from 1 to 8. Default value: 3.


**Note:** oss\_flush\_block\_size and oss\_flush\_block\_size are invalid for the import mode.

## Auxiliary function {#section_uw1_x3g_wdb .section}

FUNCTION oss\_fdw\_list\_file \(relname text, schema text DEFAULT 'public'\)

-   Used to get the name and size of the OSS file that an external table matches.

-   The unit of file size is byte.


```
select * from oss_fdw_list_file('t_oss');
              name | size    

 oss_test/test.gz. 1 | 739698350
 oss_test/test.gz. 2 | 739413041
 oss_test/test.gz. 3 | 739562048
(3 rows)
```

## Auxiliary feature {#section_tn2_z3g_wdb .section}

oss\_fdw.rds\_read\_one\_file: In read mode, used to specify a file that matches the external table. Once it is set, the external table matches only one file that is set during data import.

For example, set oss\_fdw.rds\_read\_one\_file = ‘oss\_test/example16.csv. 1’;

```
set oss_fdw.rds_read_one_file = 'oss_test/test.gz. 2';
select * from oss_fdw_list_file('t_oss');
              name | size    

  oss_test/test.gz. 2 | 739413041
(1 rows)
```

## oss\_fdw example {#section_pgb_bjg_wdb .section}

## oss\_fdw usage tips {#section_frx_cjg_wdb .section}

-   oss\_fdw is an external table plugin developed based on the PostgreSQL FOREIGN TABLE framework.

-   The data import performance is related to the PostgreSQL cluster resources \(CPU I/O MEM MET\) and OSS.

-   For expected data import performance, ossendpoint in ossprotocol must match the region where PostgreSQL is located in Alibaba Cloud. For more information, see the reference links at the end of this article.

-   If the error "oss endpoint userendpoint not in aliyun white list" is triggered during reading of SQL statements for external tables, use these [endpoints](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/31837.htm). If the problem persists, submit a trouble ticket.


## Error handling {#section_owy_djg_wdb .section}

When an import or export error occurs, the error log contains the following information:

-   code: HTTP status code of the erroneous request.

-   error\_code: Error code returned by OSS.

-   error\_msg: Error message provided by OSS.

-   req\_id: UUID that identifies the request. When you cannot solve the problem, you can seek help from OSS development engineers by providing the req\_id.


For more information about error types, see the reference links at the end of this article. Timeout errors can be handled using oss\_ext parameters.

## Hide ID and key {#section_pmk_fjg_wdb .section}

If the id and key parameters for CREATE SERVER are not encrypted, plaintext information can be displayed using `select * from pg_foreign_server`, making id and key exposed. The symmetric encryption can be performed to hide id and key \(use different keys for different instances for enhanced protection of your information\). However, to avoid incompatibility with old instances, you cannot use methods similar to GP to add a data type.

Encrypted information:

```
postgres=# select * from pg_foreign_server ;
  srvname  | srvowner | srvfdw | srvtype | srvversion | srvacl |                                                                              srvoptions

-----------+----------+--------+---------+------------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------
 ossserver |       10 |  16390 |         |            |        | {host=oss-cn-hangzhou-zmf.aliyuncs.com，id=MD5xxxxxxxx，key=MD5xxxxxxxx，bucket=067862}

```

The encrypted information is preceded by MD5 \(total length: len%8==3\). Therefore, encryption is not performed again when the exported data is imported. But you cannot create the key and id preceded by MD5.
